The error message `botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials` indicates that the AWS SDK (boto3) used in your `sentiment_analysis_api.py` script is unable to find your AWS credentials. 

When running applications that use AWS SDKs inside a Docker container, you need to ensure that the AWS credentials are available to the SDK inside the container. There are several ways to do this:

1. **Environment Variables**: You can pass your AWS credentials as environment variables when you run the Docker container. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key> sentiment_analysis_api
```

Replace `<your-access-key>` and `<your-secret-key>` with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

2. **AWS Credentials file**: If you have an AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`), you can mount it as a volume inside the Docker container. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws sentiment_analysis_api
```

This command mounts the `~/.aws` directory from your host machine to the `/root/.aws` directory inside the Docker container.

Please note that exposing your AWS credentials can lead to security risks. Make sure to follow best practices for managing AWS credentials.
